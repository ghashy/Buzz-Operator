. When "watch" script will see a new binary in dir, it should set supervisor to run "update" script, "update" script should start a new binary app with supervisor (1 instance) then it should perform 3 health checks with delay of 3 sec, then it should compute necessary delays between "changes" (explained next) using "roll_time" option from yaml config, and using "instances_count" option from yaml config. "Change" is series of actions: 1. Set new binary app with supervisor (1 instance). 2. If all ok, drop one old instance (in conf it names like exec_stable). 3. Then it should set +1 new binary instance and -1 drop old instance, and do this until all old instances will changed with a new instance. In this time, when updating finishes, update script should exit. Supervisor should not try to restart "update" script, better if before exiting, "update" script will remove itself from superviser setup.
